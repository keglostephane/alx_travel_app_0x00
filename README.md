# Milestone 2: Creating Models, Serializers, and Seeders

## Overview

This task guides learners through creating essential backend components in
Django by defining database models, setting up serializers for API data
representation, and implementing a management command to seed the database. By
working on the duplicated `alx_travel_app_0x00` project, learners will gain
practical experience in structuring relational data, serializing it for API
endpoints, and programmatically populating the database with sample data to
simulate real-world application scenarios.

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this task, learners should be able to:

1. Model relational data in Django using appropriate fields, relationships, and
   constraints.
2. Create serializers to transform Django model instances into JSON for API
   responses.
3. Implement a management command to automate database seeding.
4. Test and validate database population using Djangoâ€™s command-line tools.
